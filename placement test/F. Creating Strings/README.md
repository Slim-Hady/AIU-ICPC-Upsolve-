# Problem: Creating Strings 

this is hard problem if you don't know recursion and backtracking so if you didn't study this topic skip the question for now

This problem asks us to take a given string and find every possible unique way to rearrange its characters (**permutations**). The results must be sorted alphabetically, and we need to count how many unique strings we found.

### The Logic

When we rearrange characters to form new strings, we are looking for **distinct permutations**. The constraint $n \le 8$ is very small, which means the total number of permutations will be small enough to generate and store (the maximum is $8! = 40,320$).

#### The Strategy
1.  **Sort the Input:** To ensure we generate the permutations in alphabetical order and handle duplicates easily, we should sort the characters of the original string first (e.g., `aabac` becomes `aaabc`).
2.  **Generate Permutations:** Use a recursive function (backtracking) or a built-in library function to find all ways to arrange the characters.
3.  **Handle Uniqueness:** Because some characters might be the same (like the three 'a's in `aabac`), different arrangements might result in the same string. Using a **Set** data structure or a specialized "next permutation" algorithm helps avoid duplicates.
4.  **Count and Print:** Store all unique strings in a list, print the size of the list, and then print each string.
